Once there was a dog named Thomas who loved to sail. One morning, Thomas jumped into his boat and set sail for Picnic Point in Lake Mendota. The weather report looked clear before he pushed off, but now he could see dark clouds in the distance. 
Regardless of the clouds that lied ahead, he decided to continue with his journey. As he began to make his way across the lake, the wind started to pick up and the water became more rough. Thomas was already a third of the way to his destination but he questioned whether or not he should turn back.
Just as he decided to head back to shore, a large wave crashed over the boat, throwing Thomas into the lake. Thomas knew it was time to start paddling back to shore, but he couldn't leave his boat. It was his most prized possession. Determined to steer his boat to safety. he swam back and climbed aboard.
